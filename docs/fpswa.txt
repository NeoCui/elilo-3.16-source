This document is irrelevant for EFI/ia32 platforms.

On all EFI/ia64 platforms, the bootloader is responsible for checking for
the presence on the EFI system partition of an updated version of the 
Floating-Point Software Assist (FPSWA) EFI driver (fpswa.efi). For every 
instance found, elilo will load the driver and let EFI decide if it is 
newer than the currently installed version. In the end at most one driver 
is kept in memory.

Elilo will look for a file called fpswa.efi in the \EFI\Intel Firmware
(there is a space between l and F) directory on ALL accessible EFI system 
partitions (including on removable media). It will do so even when elilo
is downloaded from the network. It does not look for the driver in the
ext2fs partitions.

The FPSWA reference document is available from the Intel developer's web
site at http://developer.intel.com/design/itanium.
