This package contains version 3.7 of elilo, the EFI boot loader
for IA-64(IPF),IA-32(x86) and x86_64 EFI-based platforms.


RELEASE NOTES:
--------------
	Take a look at the Changelog for a detailed list of changes 
	since 3.3a.

	- The major new feature of this release pertains to netbooting.
	  With elilo-3.4, the bootloader will look for files ONLY in the
	  directory if was downloaded from on the TFTP server. Of course,
	  if you specific absolute path, files can be placed anywhere in
	  the TFTP directory structure. This may break some setup but
	  an explicit error message is printed warning the user. 

	- There were a bunch of important bug fixes, including handling
	  of paths when booting from the local disk. 

	- Downloading of large files work with EFI versions prior to 14.60
	  where there was a bug but also with the fixed version of EFI
	  starting at 14.60.

	- There were also some updates for elilo on IA-32. The loader
	  can load unmodified Linux kernel/initrd image from either the
	  local disk or via netbooting. Thanks to Matt Tolentino at Intel
	  for the IA-32 updates.

	- The ext2fs support code is still present but is not compiled in
	  anymore. This code does not understand ext3fs and might lead to
	  errors because it does not understand the journal.

	This package is known to compile and produce working binaries
	when used in conjunction with gnu-efi-3.0a. This package is
	available from the HP Labs FTP site:

	ftp://ftp.hpl.hp.com/pub/linux-ia64/gnu-efi-3.0a.tar.gz	

	For IA-64, a toolchain know to produce working binaries is:
		gcc-3.1
		binutiuls 2.13.90

	Your may have problems with newer toolchains due to some
	dependencies in the gnu-efi package. Those dependencies
	will be fixed eventually.

	For IA-32, the Redhat 8.0 toolchain is known to produce
	working binaries when used with gnu-efi-3.0a + loader
	script patch which is included in the gnu-efi-3.0a-ia32.patch
	in this package. The toolchain includes:

	gcc: gcc version 3.2 20020903 (Red Hat Linux 8.0 3.2-7)
	as : GNU assembler version 2.13.90.0.2 (i386-redhat-linux) 
	    using BFD version 2.13.90.0.2 20020802
	ld : GNU ld version 2.13.90.0.2 20020802

	The Redhat 9.0 toolchain does not work at the moment.

	For x86_64, a toolchain known to produce working binaries is:
		gcc-4.1.1 or above
		binutils-2.17.50.0.14 with Intel64 EFI support
	For x86_64, the following libraries are required for the elilo build
		gnu-efi library with x86_64

DOCUMENTATION:
--------------
	PLEASE READ THE docs/elilo.txt file for some documentation on how
	to use this program. For netbooting refer to docs/netbooting.txt.

	Make sure you read the README.gnu-efi file for required packages.
