Some of the things TO DO:
-------------------------
	- a better device naming scheme (take into account removable media)

	- ability to rescan devices like when something gets inserted just
	  before invoking elilo and the efi shell is not used (the mount())

	- ability to list files from the interactive mode

	- GUI-based chooser (a la RH9.x)!

	- UGA support?

	- Convert all filesystems (ext2fs, netfs) to use the FilesystemProtocol interface instead

	- cleanup x86 loader: use the same structure as IA-64
